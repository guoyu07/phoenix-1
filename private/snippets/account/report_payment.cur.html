            <h2>Step 1: Write Your Cheque</h2>

            <p>Your cheque should be written out in Hong Kong dollars to the balance shown below. Please remember that any cheques that have been reported but CIS has not received or processed yet <strong>are not shown in this balance</strong>. We strongly suggest you keep a separate print-out of your payment confirmation for your records.</p>

            <p>Cheques should be made payable to <strong>CHINESE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL</strong> and dated <strong>{{today}}</strong>.</p>
            
            {{message}}

            <p>On the reverse side of your cheque, write <strong>Family #{{family_id}}</strong> and your registered account name, <strong>{{family_name}}</strong>. Please ensure that your child(ren)'s names are written on the back of the cheque as well. Then proceed to Step 2.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Record This Payment</h2>
            <p>To expedite processing your cheque, please enter all the details below in regards to this particular cheque.</p>

            <div class="form-row" id="form-name">

            <h2>Step 3: Submit, Print and Mail</h2>
            <p>When you hit the Submit button, we will enter the cheque details you gave us in Step 3 into our database for expedited processing. <strong>This does not constitute payment</strong>, but notifies our staff to start looking out for your cheque.</p>

            <p>A window will pop-up: print <strong>two copies</strong> of this page (black and white is fine). Put one copy along with your cheque into an envelope and mail it to our office at the address below. Keep the other copy for your own records. You <strong>will not have access to this pop-up payment stub after you exit this page</strong>.</p>

            <p>A mailing address will be provided on this pop-up payment stub.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-yellow" id="info_bar">If a new window does not open, please disable your pop-up blocker!</div>
