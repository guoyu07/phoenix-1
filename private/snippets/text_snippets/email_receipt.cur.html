Dear parent,

This is to formally acknowledge that your cheque has been received, your receipt can be found at the bottom of this email following this message. Kindly ensure by logging in that there is no outstanding balance. Furthermore, your schedule will be ready to view and print on or after Thursday, 20 June. The following are some last minute details that you must remember before we open our Program on Monday:

1) Please ensure that your child has a copy of his/her schedule at all times. It does not need to be current, as our staff will have access to last-minute classroom changes.

2) Attire: It is important that children wear sensible clothes for the Program and closed-toe shoes for science courses

3) Snacks: Remember when packing snacks for your children that CIS is a peanut-free zone.Should you wish to provide an allowance to purchase snacks at the cafeteria it is advisable that they carry an octopus card in lieu of cash. 

4) In an effort to be environmentally friendly we'd like to encourage you to provide your child with a reusable water bottle.

5) For any guardians/nannies/helpers/drivers dropping and collecting students around campus and/or staying on campus throughout the day: please be sure to carry a corresponding copy of the child's schedule in the event that verification is required

6) Cars: There is no parking available for any Program students/famillies and there is to be no dropping off in front of the school. Please drop-off your children at the Moongate instead.

Should you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us at 2512-5961 or via email.

Best regards,
Summer Program Office
