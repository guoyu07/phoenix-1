        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>The CIS Summer Program is one of Hong Kong's oldest continuously running international school summer school programs, operating since the summer of 1995. We're pleased to bring to you The CIS Summer Program 2013!</p>
        <p>This year's program will run for <strong>four weeks</strong>. Like the 2012 Program, we will be offering two different sessions of the program catering to different needs: the traditional <strong>Summer Program</strong> for kids age 5 and up, and the <strong>Academic Program</strong> for students who have just graduated Years 10 through 12 (that's Form 4 or 9th Grade through Form 6/11th Grade).</p>

			<h2>CIS Summer Program</h2>
            <blockquote>
                The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.
                <cite>Plutarch, Roman author and historian</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our Summer Program for children <strong>ages 5 and up</strong> has been running continuously since 1995 and we aim to provide the most enjoyable learning experience during the summer for parents and students alike. All courses are taught by experienced CIS teachers, so come see what CIS has to offer, whether you're a seasoned parent or curious to see what one of Hong Kong's best international schools is all about.</p>
            <p>This year, our courses will be split into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Arts</strong> <span class="muted">ARTS</span>: Offering both visual and performing arts courses, such as Chinese calligraphy, pottery, cartoon drawing, hip-hop dance, filmmaking. These courses are favourites for many of our children.</li>
                <li><strong>Languages</strong> <span class="muted">LANG</span>: Let your child's creativity and linguistic power flourish wish our English and Chinese classes in varying degrees of difficulty.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics and Critical Thinking</strong> <span class="muted">MACT</span>: Our maths courses introduce and review concepts learned in day school, from simple arithmetic up to middle and high-school level mathematics. Plus, let your child learn chess or Go in our new critical thinking category of classes!</li>
                <li><strong>Science, Computers and Technology</strong> <span class="muted">SCIT</span>: A plethora of science exploration and investigation courses, and new this year - computer courses ranging from learning how to type to making websites (<em>almost</em> as beautiful as this one!)</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Education</strong> <span class="muted">PHED</span>: Exercise is important - and there's nowhere better to do it than at a school that sports (no pun intended) an indoor swimming pool, tennis and basketball courts and several indoor gymnasiums.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can <strong>preview our course list</strong> before you even register! You'll get to see these courses as early as March once we release them.</p>

            <h3>SP Schedule</h3>
            <p>Our Summer Program schedule this year has changed this year so students can avoid morning traffic and late dismissal. Here's the daily schedule for this year's Program:</p>
            <div class="alert alert-yellow"><span class="badge badge-yellow">FYI</span> Starting this year, classes will be <strong>55 minutes long</strong> to give your children ample time to go to their next classroom. This way, they won't miss anything important!</div>

			<h2>The Academic Program</h2>
			<blockquote>
			    Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
			    <cite>Confucius, Chinese philosopher</cite>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>The Academic Program was first introduced in  2012 as an afternoon addition to tutor students in secondary school with IB and SAT exam preparation. This year, we're proud to expand that program into the morning, and offer a larger selection of courses.</p>
			
			<h3>SAT Subject Test and IB Prep Courses</h3>
			<p>All our courses are taught by CIS teachers who have had many years of experience in teaching their subject. CIS is one of the first schools in Hong Kong to offer IB: both the Diploma Program and the Middle Years Program.</p>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>IB Taster Courses</strong> <span class="muted">IBTC</span>: Prepare for IB studies and explore your options before you have to make your course decisions! Teachers will go through the prerequisites and basics of the subject and through some earlier class material.</li>
                <li><strong>SAT Subject Test Courses</strong> <span class="muted">SATS</span>: These courses are aimed particularly at filling the gaps that IB leaves in order for students to ace their upcoming SAT Subject Tests. Teachers will go through all exam material while focussing on familiarizing students with material that will not have been taught in their day school classes when they take the exam.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>NEW: Post-Secondary Courses</h3>
            <p>These interest courses will give your child valuable insight into college and career choices for the future. More liberal in nature, these new classes offer experiences that secondary school classrooms just cannot afford to give. Don't graduate clueless - let our teachers and alumni give you their advice so you can venture into adulthood with confidence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Career Pathways</strong> <span class="muted">PATH</span>: Explore the vast number of opportunities your future holds through an interactive, curated program taught by CIS teachers. Learn the secrets to university and working life, resumes/CVs, interviews and for special interest.</li>
                <li><strong>CIS 101</strong> <span class="muted">CISO</span>: Both academic and career taster courses so better prepare Year 10-12 students for future study or as a means of interest that adds to the CIS curriculum. Introductory workshops into various subject areas such as law, engineering, art development and literature are offered.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert">CISO courses are taught by CIS teachers or CIS alumni who hold degrees in their respective fields. All instructors undergo a strict interviewing and selection process.</div>

            <h3>Buses</h3>
            <p>Students taking morning classes may choose to take the same bus service as students in the Summer Program. There will be no home return bus service for Academic Program students.</p>
