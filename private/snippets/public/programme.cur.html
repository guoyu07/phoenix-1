        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>The CIS Summer Programme is one of Hong Kong's oldest continuously running international school summer school programmes, operating since the summer of 1995. We're pleased to bring to you The CIS Summer Programme 2013!</p>
        <p>This year's programme will run for <strong>four weeks</strong>. Like the 2012 Programme, we will be offering two different sessions of the programme catering to different needs: the traditional <strong>Summer Programme</strong> for kids age 5 and up, and the <strong>Academic Programme</strong> for students who have just graduated Years 9 through 12 (that's Form 3/8th Grade through Form 6/11th Grade).</p>

			<h2>The Summer School</h2>
            <blockquote>
                The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.
                <cite>Plutarch, Roman author and historian</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our Summer School for children <strong>ages 5 and up</strong> has been running continuously since 1995 and we aim to provide the safest, most enjoyable learning experience during the summer. Many of our students come from outside CIS as well, with parent and child alike coming to see what CIS has to offer.</p>
            <p>This year, our courses will be split into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Arts</strong> <span class="muted">ARTS</span>: Offering both visual and performing arts courses, such as Chinese calligraphy, pottery, cartoon drawing, hip-hop dance, filmmaking. These courses are favourites for many of our children.</li>
                <li><strong>Languages</strong> <span class="muted">LANG</span>: Let your child's creativity and linguistic power flourish wish our English and Chinese classes in varying degrees of difficulty.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics and Critical Thinking</strong> <span class="muted">MACT</span>: Our maths courses introduce and review concepts learned in day school, from simple arithmetic up to middle and high-school level mathematics. Plus, let your child learn chess or Go in our new critical thinking category of classes!</li>
                <li><strong>Science, Computers and Technology</strong> <span class="muted">SCIT</span>: A plethora of science exploration and investigation courses, and new this year - computer courses ranging from learning how to type to making websites (<em>almost</em> as beautiful as this one!)</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Education</strong> <span class="muted">PHED</span>: Exercise is important - and there's nowhere better to do it than at a school that sports (no pun intended) an indoor swimming pool, tennis and basketball courts and several indoor gymnasiums.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Make sure you <strong>preview our course list</strong> before you even register! You'll get to see these courses as early as March as we release them.</p>

            <h3>SS Schedule</h3>
            <p>Our Summer School schedule this year has changed just a little from previous years to let your child get off school a little earlier, and to avoid that horrible early morning rush hour traffic. Here's the daily schedule for this year's Programme:</p>
            <div class="alert alert-yellow"><span class="badge badge-yellow">FYI</span> Starting this year, classes will be <strong>55 minutes long</strong> to give your children ample time to go between classes. This way, they won't miss anything important!</div>

			<h2>The Academic Programme</h2>
			<blockquote>
			    Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
			    <cite>Confucius, Chinese philosopher</cite>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>The Senior Academic Programme was first introduced in the 2012 Programme as an afternoon programme to help students in secondary school with IB and SAT exam preparation. This year, we're proud to expand that programme into the morning, and offer a larger selection of courses.</p>
			
			<h3>IB Courses</h3>
			<p>All our IB courses are taught by CIS teachers who have had many years of experience in teaching their subject. CIS is one of the first schools in Hong Kong to offer IB (both the Diploma Program and the Middle Years Program) and has consistently produced graduating cohorts with some of the best results in the world. We invite you and your child to take part in this valuabl experience!</p>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>IB Taster Courses</strong> <span class="muted">IBTC</span>: Restricted to incoming Years 10-12, these broad courses give students a general idea of what to expect in certain IB subjects, such as Economics or Biology. It also helps students get prepared for their entrance into IB studies.</li>
                <li><strong>IB Review</strong> <span class="muted">IBRV</span>: These courses, for incoming Year 13, will review the material taught in the past year and prepare students for their last year of secondary school.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>University Applications Writing Courses</h3>
			<p>(Code <span class="muted">UNIW</span>) This year, we are also offering students the chance to draft, review, and edit their university application written statements with CIS teachers and staff. Writing university app statements can be a difficult and arduous task, but these courses will help your child plan, write and improve every personal statment or application essay that they write.</p>
