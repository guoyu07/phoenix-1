    <h2>Methods of Payment</h2>
    <p>CIS accepts tuition payment <strong>by cheque only</strong>. Your family account will have a running bill of all credited items and payments. If you will be mailing cheques, we recommend pre-confirm your payment online so we can process your payment faster. We must receive either the cheque itself or this pre-confirmation before the due date or the <strong>system will drop enrolment on all late items</strong>.</p>
    <p>Please make your cheques payable to <strong>Chinese International School</strong>. Receipts are given only upon request and only at the Programme office.</p>

    <h3>Non-Hong Kong Residents</h3>
    <p>For students coming to Hong Kong to attend the Summer Programme, you may arrange an Electronic Funds Transfer as payment in certain circumstances. An additional fee may apply. Please make a Help Desk request for alternative payment after logging in to your account. We will reply with the details necessary for you to make this transfer.</p>
    <p>Transfers must be arranged as soon as possible in order to avoid an automatic cancellation of your enrolment due to late/unpai items.</p>
