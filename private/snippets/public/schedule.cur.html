    <h2>Methods of Payment</h2>
    <p>CIS accepts tuition payment <strong>by cheque only</strong>. Your family account will have a running bill of all credited items and payments. If you will be mailing cheques, we recommend pre-confirm your payment online so we can process your payment faster. We must receive either the cheque itself or this pre-confirmation before the due date or the <strong>system will drop enrolment on all late items</strong>.</p>
    <p>Please make your cheques payable to <strong>Chinese International School</strong>. Receipts are given only upon request and only at the Program office.</p>
    <div class="floatbox floatbox-right">
        <strong>Mail cheques to:</strong><br />
        Business Office (Attn: Summer Program)<br />
        Chinese International School<br />

    <h3>Non-Hong Kong Residents</h3>
    <p>The Summer Program is popular both inside and outside of Hong Kong, and we have had many international students in the past. If you are planning to accompany or send your children to Hong Kong, please let us know on the Help Center after you login. Our Office can assist in enrollment, payment and various issues relating to the Program, however, CIS does not offer room and board, nor can we provide housing or other accomodations.</p>
    <p>Electronic Fund Transfers must be arranged as soon as possible in order to avoid an automatic cancellation of your enrolment due to late/unpaid items.</p>
