        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-reporting cheque payment</strong>: This is our new, recommended payment method. You may at your convenience, before payment due date, login to our website to make a payment by entering cheque details (account number, cheque amount) and mailing a cheque. Our office must receive your mailed physical cheque with matching details within <strong>5 business days</strong>, or the payment will be marked as invalid.</li>

            <li><strong>Electronic funds transfer</strong>: We do not offer this payment method online or in person and is meant as a convenience for families outside Hong Kong who do not have established Hong Kong banking accounts. You must receive authorisation from the Summer Program and CIS Business Office prior to making a payment. Fees may apply.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash</strong>: Only available for change fee or late add fee payment and must be paid in cash. <strong>Do not mail cash.</strong> A receipt will be issued upon request.</li>
