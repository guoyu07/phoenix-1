        <h2>Tuition Payment</h2>
        
        <p>Your enrollments are not guaranteed until you make full payment, including any fees associated with each enrollment transaction. Please review our payment policy below.</p>

        <h3>General Items</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Failure to pay or self-report cheque information (see below) by the due date will result in an immediate drop on that week's classes. Our system <strong>will automatically remove you from all classes in a particular week</strong> should the system determine that you have not cleared your account for that week.</li>
            <li>You may choose to re-enrol in dropped classes but your enrollment is subject to availability at the time that we receive full payment. It is suggested that you make late registrations in person.</li>
            <li>Receipts are only given if requested after an in-person payment. We do not mail out receipts.</li>
            <li>Please make cheques out to <strong>Chinese International School</strong>.</li>
            <li>In the event of a bounced cheque, we reserve the right to charge you an additional bank reprocessing fee. You will be duly contacted if such a fee will be levied.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
        
        <p>Payments are accepting using the methods described below only. We do not accept credit card, traveler's cheques or money order of any kind.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In-person cheque payment</strong>: You may hand in your cheque to our office directly at any time the office is open. You may request a receipt using this payment method. Please hand in your cheque before the payment deadline.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-reporting cheque payment</strong>: For both your and our convenience, you may self-report a mailed cheque to our office. You can use the "Report a Payment" function on your Dashboard after signing in and our system will ask for your basic cheque information (cheque number, value of payment, bank). Upon submitting this information, we will mark that amount as temporarily paid. You will have <strong>5 business days</strong> from marking that payment as paid for us to receive it before we mark that account as unpaid and drop your respective courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Electronic funds transfer</strong>: We do not offer this payment method online or in person. It is meant as a convenience for families outside Hong Kong who do not have established Hong Kong banking accounts. You must receive authorisation from the Summer Programme and CIS Business Office prior to making a payment. Fees may apply.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash</strong>: Only available for change fee or late add fee payment and must be paid in cash. <strong>Do not mail cash.</strong> A receipt will be issued upon request.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="clear">Refund Policy</h2>
        
        <p>Please review our terms and conditions for refunds of any kind in conjunction with the Summer Programme.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Refunds will be given on the tuition paid minus any miscellaneous charges including, but not limited to: late/change admin fees, course materials fees, and reimbursement fees.</li>
            <li>Refund and withdrawal requests must be made within the deadline (see Fee &amp; Tuition Schedule above) to receive a 100% refund.</li>
            <li>A returned cheque (in person only) shall suffice as a full refund. You may also request that we shred your cheque.</li>
            <li>Refunds on alternative payments must be pre-authorised by CIS personnel and could take several weeks to process.</li>
            <li>Withdrawal requests will be charged a <strong>25% administration charge</strong> if made after the deadline for each separate week withdrawn. This charge will be taken out of your total refund for that week.</li>
        </ul>
