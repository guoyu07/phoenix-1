        <h2>Age Limitation Policy</h2>
        
        <p>The CIS Summer Program is best enjoyed by students aged five and up. Due to safety policies, we unfortunately cannot cater to children aged 4 or lower before the beginning of class. For individual courses, it may be possible to enroll a child who is slightly too young or too old as specified by the course age range - see the PTE system below.</p>

        <p>Age limitations are calculated <strong>on the day of the first period of the specified class</strong>. For example, if your child turns of age to attend a class a few days before its starting session, then the system will automatically allow you to attend. This will occur even if your child is not yet of age during the registration period. However, if your child turns of age after the first day of class, or slightly after, our system will by default not allow you to register into that course.</p>

        <h2>Permission-to-Enroll System</h2>

        <p>In response to parent feedback, we introduced the Permission-to-Enroll, or <strong>PTE System</strong> as a leniency and manual registration method. We understand that age is not a perfect indication of experience, so we've introduced this policy. Please read the following items if you wish to submit a PTE request.</p>

        <p>To make a PTE request:</p>

        <ol class="numeral">
            <li>Login and select the child you wish to make a request for.</li>
            <li>Ensure that this child's schedule is <strong>already submitted</strong> and has a course selected. We will use this course as a backup in the event that your request is denied.</li>
            <li>Go to the Help Center and <strong>Create a PTE Request</strong>.</li>
            <li>We will respond within 2 business days with a response. If your request is approved, the backup course will be automatically replaced with your requested PTE class. If denied, your schedule will not change. You may also choose to withdraw from this period, but you cannot have gaps in your schedule (i.e: if you decide to withdraw a Period 3 class, you must also withdraw from Period 4).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We receive <em>many PTE requests</em> per day. To ensure fairness and efficiency of this sytem, please note these simple house rules. It helps us to avoid misunderstandings between the office and parents themselves.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>PTE requests are only available for children aged one year lower than the course minimum, or one year higher than the course minimum (i.e: A PTE request cannot be made for a child aged 7 for a course with a minimum age limit of 9 years).</li>
            <li>PTE requests <strong>may not be made</strong> for courses that use CIS science labs due to safety regulations.</li>
            <li>If a backup is not selected, a PTE request cannot be made for that period. Please select a backup <strong>and</strong> submit a schedule before making a request.</li>
            <li>Summer Program Office responses to PTE requests are final and unfortunately cannot be repealed. We understand that many parents are motivated, however, we receive many requests and other parents are equally eager.</li>
            <li>We will often prioritise parents who have children of age before approving PTE requests.</li>
        </ul>
