        <p><strong>The short answer</strong>: We take your privacy seriously. Any personal data you submit to us will be kept in the strictest confidence. You will always have the right to view and remove your data from our servers at any time.</p>
        
        <h2>Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</h2>
        
        <p>According to Hong Kong law, the <strong>Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</strong> (Cap. 486) requires us to disclose to you the types of personal information we gather, the reasons why we do so, and security practises we have in place to protect your sensitive data.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions regarding this policy, please do not hesitate to contact any of the secretaries.</p>
        
        <h2>What data we gather</h2>
        
        <p>Personal data is gathered on a user-approved basis. This means that you submit this information to us in order to access certain features and sections of this website. Some of this personal information includes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, mailing address and phone numbers</li>
            <li>Your children's names, basic information and medical information</li>
            <li>Other demographic information including, but not limited to, schools of attendance and emergency contacts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In addition to personal data, we gather anonymised computer and network data and other metrics for our own internal use. These items are collected when you visit our website, and your usage of any part of our website assumes acceptance of these terms. The items we gather include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Computer operating system and browser type and version information</li>
            <li>Browser capabilities (CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript in particular)</li>
            <li>Screen information including resolution and colour depth</li>
            <li>Network addresses (IP address), location (city level) and network provider information</li>
            <li>Tracking devices to record your traverses through our web site</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why we gather the data</h2>
        
        <p>Personal data gathered is used to validate and authenticate users into the web site in order to access customised and other personal information. The nature of the website requires information of the subscribers (your children) to our events (classes) in order to guarantee enrolmentx and smooth operation of the program.</p>
        
        <p>Computer data is gathered unless otherwise disallowed. We aim to gather this data to better serve our customers - and the data helps us to identify how our customers use the website, who these customers are, and records any errors that they might have received during their visit.</p>
        
        <h2>How we protect your data</h2>
        
        <p>All types of data gathered by the program and the website are kept under strict confidentiality rules and policies. We have a very robust access control policy for staff - and all of your personal information is kept on a need-to-know basis. In addition, all data is kept on servers in an off-site location with state-of-the-art CCTV secured datacentres and under lock and key.</p>
        
        <p>Our software is kept updated, and security is of paramount importance. Any and all passwords are kept via a randomised unreversible scrambling process ("salted" and "hashed"), and will never be kept in plain-text anywhere on the server or elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p>Should you wish to purge your data from our servers, you must write to Chinese International School by mail, and your request will be processed within a reasonable period of time. Chinese International School reserves the right to charge a fee per request.</p>
